    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I have often described myself as "eclectic". I love to program, cook, and play music.

      In 2018 I attended Academy PGH where I learned to think like a developer. John and Jean Lange taught me how to learn on the job and adapt quickly to new technologies. 
      
      I am a young and professional programmer, with a strong interest in learning more about the world!
