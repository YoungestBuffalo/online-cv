    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I was first exposed to programming in middle school when my family moved from our home in Spokane, Washington to the South Hills of Pittsburgh. I wasn’t exactly a model student, I was excited to learn, I liked playing music, and I loved computer games. The traditional school system felt constrictive to creative thought and seemed to reward the wrong style of learning. Personally, I had better experiences with learning through different styles of mentorship. While graduating from Mount Lebanon I struggled to find something that spoke to my core as a career path. I wasn’t extremely keen on continuing my traditional education, but I felt the pressure to continue academically, especially because of the importance of a degree in most fields. I enrolled in college to study biology at Unity College in Maine. After a semester of undergrad I knew that I wanted to do something different. I finished my first year of studies, and moved back to Pittsburgh to find work. I eventually found that programming was a great thing to study! It satisfies my interest in understanding complex ideas, my pursuit of challenging material, and my passion for creativity. I have found the most value studying software development on my own and with various mentors. I enjoy coding because I am always learning new methods and styles and most communities online are encouraging and open minded.
      TL;DR I am a hireable, young, professional, entry level programmer and bootcamp grad, with a strong interest in learning new and interesting material. (preferably at a job/contract)
